# Ultimate Soccer Quiz

## Introduction

The "Ultimate Soccer Quiz" is a php based quiz that tests your soccer knowledge. Most of the questions are basic just to see if you know anything about the biggest and greatest sport in the world. 

## Purpose

Made the quiz to challenge and test my knowledge of php loops and control statements.

## Setting up my workspace

- Created Repository
- Opened terminal and launched the command 'git clone "repo link"'
- Created base folder structure (sass, css, and images)
- Pushed Changes

## Learning

In this project I learned how to use foreach loops in php to make a form.

I also learned how combine php, html and css to make the site look nice.

Something new that I also learned was to make a fireworks effect using only css.

## Getting Started

1. In the repository copy the link at the Clone or download button.

2. Open git bash and type "git clone" then paste the copied link and press enter.

3. Cd into the folder then copy the path.

4. Create a virtual host using wamp, lamp or mamp with the name of your choosing and paste the path to create your virtual host.

5. Refresh wamp and then open the virtual host and then you can do the quiz and see how much you know.
